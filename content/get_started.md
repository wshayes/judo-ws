## Step 1

Come to a few classes to see if you like it. 

Please contact the [Club Secretary](mailto:william.s.hayes@gmail.com?subject=Auburn%20Judo%20Club%20question) to arrange a visit since we sometimes have to cancel classes due to holidays or other events. We can also answer any questions you may have and make sure you have the right clothing for your first class.

Classes are held on Wednesday evenings from 6-8pm and Saturday mornings from 9-11am.

## Step 2

If you like it, you can join the club. The cost is $125 per year (just the cost of the membership to the Auburn Sportsman's Club). The process to join is listed [here](https://auburnsportsmansclub.com/index.php/membership/).

## Step 3

Enjoy a lifetime of learning and fun!
